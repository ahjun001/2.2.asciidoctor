== Paragraphs
Hardline breaks
No breaks here.
Even though there are in the .adoc doc.

Breaks here +
<space><+><CR> will break +
Line 1. +
Line 2. +
Line 3. + some more text. If + is not followed by <CR> then it does not break.

[%hardbreaks]
With [%hardbreaks] above paragraph, a <CR>
just breaks.

But only<CR>
(the preceding and following <CR> will be ignored!)
for a paragraph.

[.lead]
This text will be styled as a lead paragraph (i.e., larger font).

This paragraph will not be.


== Text formatting

*bold :* It has *strong* significance to me.

_italics :_ I _cannot_ stress this enough.

`monospace red :` Type `OK` to accept.

*_bold & italics (in that order) :_* That *_really_* has to go.

`*_bold, italics, & monospace red :_*`  Can't pick one? Let's use them `*_all_*`.

== Unconstrained bold, italic, and monospace

**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete (CRUD)

That's fan__freakin__tastic!

Don't pass generic ``Object``s to methods that accept ``String``s!

It was Beatle``**__mania__**``!

== Highlight, underline, strikethrough, and custom role

#highlighted :# Werewolves are allergic to #cinnamon#.

#highlighted unconstrained :# ##Mark##up refers to text that contains formatting ##mark##s.

[.underline]#underlined :# Where did all the [.underline]#cores# go?

[.line-through]#line-through :# We need [.line-through]#ten# twenty VMs.

[.myrole]#has nothing yet :# A [.myrole]#custom role# must be fulfilled by the theme.

== Superscript and subscript
^superscript(noSpaces):^  ^super^script phrase

~sub-script(noSpaces):~  ~sub~script phrase

== Smart quotes and apostrophes
"`double curved quotes`". "Double straight quotes" seems to work as well.

'`single curved quotes`'. 'Single straight quotes' seems to work as well.

== Inline anchors or bookmarks

[[bookmark-a]]Inline anchors make arbitrary content referenceable. +
Refer to <<bookmark-a>> when you want to point to it.

[[bookmark-b]]#Inline anchors can be applied to a phrase like this one, this is a phrase referred as bookmark-b.#

[#bookmark-b1]bookmark-b1 is defined in shorthand. Not a problem at definition, but trigerring a warning when crossreferenced.

anchor:bookmark-c[]Use a cross reference to link to this location.

[[bookmark-d,last paragraph]]The xreflabel (cross-reference label) attribute will be used as link text in the cross-reference link.  This one will show as last paragraph.

== Cross references

== Lists

From snippets: unordered list

* first
** nest
*** 2nd nest
*** again
** back
* second
* third

adjacent lists

* (i) first
* (ii) second
* (iii) third
[]
* [x] continuation

* [x] a list

* [x] should be appart from previous
[]
* [ ] not appart


== Ordered list max level nesting

. Level 1 list item
.. Level 2 list item
... Level 3 list item
.... Level 4 list item
..... Level 5 list item
. Level 1 list item

== Unordered checklists
* [*] checked
* [x] same check
* [ ] not checked
* normal list item 

== Ordered list, style & start #
["lowerroman", start=5]
. Five
. Six
[loweralpha]
.. a
.. b
.. c
. Seven

== Description lists

First term:: The description can be placed on the same line
as the term.  Will show below though.
Second term::
Description of the second term.
The description can also start on its own line.

== Question and answer list
[qanda]
What is the answer?::
This is the answer.

Have you seen my duck?:: No.

== Mixed lists

// describing with ::
Operating Systems:: 
//describing with :::
  Linux:::
// indentation is not necessary, but more readable
    . Fedora
      * Desktop
    . Ubuntu
      * Desktop
      * Server
  BSD:::
    . FreeBSD
    . NetBSD

Cloud Providers::
  PaaS:::
    . OpenShift
    . CloudBees
  IaaS:::
    . Amazon EC2
    . Rackspace

== Complex content in outline lists
* Every list item has at least one paragraph of content,
  which may be wrapped, even using a hanging indent.
+
Additional paragraphs or blocks are adjoined by putting
a list continuation on a line adjacent to both blocks.
+
list continuation:: a plus sign (`{plus}`) on a line by itself

* A literal paragraph does not require a list continuation.

 $ cd projects/my-book

* AsciiDoc lists may contain any complex content.

== Images
need Ctrl+Shift+P / AsciiDoc Change Preview Security Settings 

To include an image on its own line (i.e., a block image), use the `image::` prefix in front of the file name and square brackets after it.

If you want to specify alt text, include it inside the square brackets:

// there should be no space after the point
.The title of the image
image::logo.svg[Text to display if image cannot,50,50]
image::phantom_image.svg[Text to display if image cannot]

footnote:[Some text, click on footnote # to get back to original position] now that's interesting

An open block can be an anonymous container,
or it can masquerade as any other block.

puts "I'm a source block!"

=== Passthrough block
++++
<p>
Content in a passthrough block is passed to the output unprocessed.
That means you can include raw HTML, like this embedded Gist:
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mojavelinux/5333524.js">

* Goal 2
* Goal 3
  
// same as 
// [id="goals",role="incremental"]

Shorthand method for assigning block options

header = {header}


// footer has a grey background in pdf
[%header%footer%autowidth]
|===
|Header A |Header B
|Some row |Some row
|Some row |Some row
|Footer A |Footer B

== Attributes and substitutions

:summary: Asciidoctor is a mature, plain-text document format for \
       writing notes, articles, documentation, books, and more. \
       It's also a text processor & toolchain for translating \
       documents into various output formats (i.e., backends), \
       including HTML, DocBook, PDF and ePub.

// insert link as {weblink}[text to display]
Check out {url-home}[Asciidoctor]!

// plain substitution
{summary}

// {weblink}[text to display] can be the entity substituted
Be sure to read the {link-docs} too!

{bold_check} That's done!

* [*] Basic_check

:my_check_box: pass:[* [*]] 

{my_check_box} ok

* {normal_check} normal check
* {bold_check} bold check
* {normal_cross} normal cross
* {bold_cross} bold cross
* [ ] basic
* [*] basic


== Escaping substitutions
=== Backslash
\*Stars* isn't displayed as bold text.
The asterisks around it are preserved.

\&sect; appears as an entity reference.
It's not converted into the section symbol (&sect;).

\=> The backslash prevents the equals sign followed by a greater
than sign from combining to form a double arrow character (=>).

\[[Word]] is not interpreted as an anchor.
The double brackets around it are preserved.

[\[[Word]]] is not interpreted as a bibliography anchor.
The triple brackets around it are preserved.

The URL \https://example.org isn't converted into an active link.


== Triple plus inline macro and inline pass macro

+++<u>underline me</u>+++ is underlined.

pass:[<u>underline me</u>] is also underlined.

The previous definition was:

[.underline]#underlined :# Where did all the [.underline]#cores# go?



== Footnotes
Normal and reusable footnotes

A statement.footnote:[Clarification about this statement.]

A bold statement!footnote:disclaimer2[Opinions are also my own.]

Another bold statement.footnote:disclaimer2[]
